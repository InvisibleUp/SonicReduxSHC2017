Copy your original 1998 SONICR.EXE to this directory, then compile and run "build.c" to create REDUX.EXE.
This will require the GNU assembler and binutils installed on your system!
Note that ONLY "redux.asm" is assembled. Any additional code files are only for reference and may be outdated or unused. To edit C code, re-compile it using the -S flag and copy/paste it in place into "redux.asm". Do keep in mind that manual ASM changes were required for some source files.
